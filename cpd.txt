CPD activity
Introduction to Web Development

What have I learnt?
Learnt about setting up the tools and starting on the code. Learnt very basics of using VS studio, Github and Github desktop. 


How did I use this in practice?
Edited this text CPD and pushed it into Github using Github desktop. 


What did I find hard?
It took me a few minutes to understand how to set up github desktop and how to push to live. 
I got a bit confused when cloning the code from the LTU github into my github and then opening it in VS.
