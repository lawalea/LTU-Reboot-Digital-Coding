Introduction to Web Development

What have I learnt?
Learnt about setting up the tools and starting on the code. Learnt very basics of using VS studio, Github and Github desktop. 


How did I use this in practice?
Edited this text CPD and pushed it into Github using Github desktop. 


What did I find hard?
It took me a few minutes to understand how to set up github desktop and how to push to live. 
I got a bit confused when cloning the code from the LTU github into my github and then opening it in VS.

Lesson 5 - HTML
What have I learnt?
All about HTML including:
A bit of history
Difference between HTML, CSS and Javascript
To make sure I nest my code correctly
HTML is great for accessability, CSS is more on making things look fancy
Different types of images


How did I use this in practice?
I did my tasks for module 2. I was able to do them quite quickly which was great. 



What did I find hard?
I struggled a bit with the image a link task. I found that Alex had gone a bit fast so I missed what was happening. I was able to work out how to fix it by checking W3 schools.
